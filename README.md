## Introduction

This is an interactive game similar to the classic card game, Concentration. This is Project 2 of Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree program. Please visit [Udacity's Catalog](https://www.udacity.com/courses/all) of courses for further information.

## Instructions

Click on individual squares until a matching pair of cards is found. Continue until all cards have been matched and displayed and the game is won. Once all cards have been matched your time and star rating will display. Stars are lost based on how many moves are made, so try to remember which card is where!

## Contributing

This game was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Much of the HTML, CSS and the JavaScript shuffle function starter code was provided by Udacity. The basic game board design and card icons were provided by Udacity.
