## Introduction

This is an interactive game similar to the classic card game, Concentration.
This is Project 2 of Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree program. Please
visit [Udacity's Catalog](https://www.udacity.com/courses/all) of courses for
further information.

## Instructions

Click on individual squares until a matching pair of cards is found.
Continue until all cards have been matched and displayed and the game is won.
Once all cards have been matched your time and star rating will display.
Stars are lost based on how many moves are made, so try to remember which card
 is where!
